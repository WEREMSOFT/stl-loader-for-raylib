The stl-loader-for-raylib runtime provides functionality to load, manipulate and render stl files on raylib.

One of the most amazing features of [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/), besides the ease of use and its numerous ports to several languages, is the ability to compile to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), allowing to show your games around the world with just a link.
